## What Happens Next

Your responses will be used to generate a **personalized set of lab exercises**
using real scenarios from your work (with fictional data). The exercises will
walk you through Claude Code workflows that directly map to the tasks,
documents, and pain points you described above.

No proprietary or confidential information from your answers will appear in the
exercises — we use your responses only to understand your context and create
relevant examples.
